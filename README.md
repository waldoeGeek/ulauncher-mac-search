# MAC Address lookup
### Look up vendor information by mac address

I am not the best with python. This is my forst real world project.

Just start typing your MAC address and if it is found it will display vendor information.  
Press `enter` to bring up the url in the browser

**Things I may add**  
-Ability to search mac range by vendor name
