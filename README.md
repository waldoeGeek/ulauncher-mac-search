# MAC Address lookup
### Look up vendor information by mac address

I am not the best with python. This is my first real world project.

Just start typing your MAC address and if it is found it will display vendor information.
supported MAC formats:  
-IEEE EUI-48
-Unix
-Unix zero padded  
-No delimiters  
-Sorry Cisco with your weird format

Press `enter` to bring up the url in the browser

**Things I may add**  
-Ability to search mac range by vendor name
